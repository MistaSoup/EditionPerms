# EditionPerms Configuration
# Define permission groups with custom prefixes and detection methods

# ==================================================================================
# BEDROCK PLAYER DETECTION
# ==================================================================================
# These settings determine HOW the plugin identifies Bedrock players
detection:
  # Bedrock players have this prefix in their username (default: ".")
  # Example: ".PlayerName" is a Bedrock player, "PlayerName" is Java
  bedrock-prefix: "."
  
  # Also check UUID format to detect Bedrock players (recommended: true)
  # Bedrock UUIDs start with "00000000-0000-0000"
  bedrock-uuid-check: true

# ==================================================================================
# PERMISSION GROUPS
# ==================================================================================
# After a player is identified as Java or Bedrock, these groups assign permissions
# Groups are applied in order - players can match multiple groups

groups:
  # Give permissions to ALL Java players
  default-java:
    type: java
    prefix: ""  # LEAVE EMPTY to apply to ALL Java players
    permissions:
      - minecraft.command.me
      - minecraft.command.trigger
  
  # Give permissions to ALL Bedrock players
  default-bedrock:
    type: bedrock
    prefix: ""  # LEAVE EMPTY to apply to ALL Bedrock players
    permissions:
